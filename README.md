## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View an age in years, months, and days after submitting a valid date through the form
- Receive validation errors if:
  - Any field is empty when the form is submitted
  - The day number is not between 1-31
  - The month number is not between 1-12
  - The year is in the future
  - The date is invalid e.g. 31/04/1991 (there are 30 days in April)
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- **Bonus**: See the age numbers animate to their final number when the form is submitted

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
-javaScript

### What I learned

In the course of this project I learnt how to make choose either of different numbers when using if statements, I also learnt how to get a positive number after calculation even when the given answer is a negative answer...

Below are some of my code snippets:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
let value = 3;
if ([1,2,3].includes(value)) {
  return "value is either, 1, 2, 3";
}

let num = -5;
let positiveNum = Math.abs(num);
```

### Continued development

In my future projects I'd love to learn how to make my javScript code lesser and more beautiful
